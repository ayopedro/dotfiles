# 🛠️ Dotfiles

My personal development environment configuration for GitHub Codespaces.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is my personal dotfiles configuration. Please review all files before using them, as they contain my preferences and may not suit your needs. Fork this repository and customize it to match your own workflow and requirements.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Fork This Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top of this page to create your own copy. This ensures you have control over your dotfiles and my changes won't affect your setup.

### 2. Configure GitHub Settings

1. Go to your **GitHub Settings**: https://github.com/settings/codespaces
2. Scroll to the **Dotfiles** section
3. Check **✓ Automatically install dotfiles**
4. Select **your forked repository**: `your-username/dotfiles`
5. (Optional) Specify the install script path: `install.sh`

That's it! Every new Codespace you create will automatically apply these configurations from your fork.

## 📦 What's Included
